*A repository to document my Python learning journey*

## About Me
I have been working as a scrum product owner and application support analyst for Java / Spring web applications for a number of years. I'm impressed by the simplicity of the Python programming language, and the incredible productivity gains that AI code generation assistants can bring to software development. 

## Goals for This Course
Become a solid Python developer, and learn/practice using AI code assistants to develop complex software fast.

## My First Python Program 
```
print ("Hello World!")
```
