# CIST-005B Week 1 - Reflections

This first week of this Advanced Python class I learned or revisited:
- fundamentals of the language (syntax, built-in data types and functions, data structures, object-oriented programming with Python)
- explored JupyterNotebook and JupyterLab and generating code in them using Anaconda Assistant
